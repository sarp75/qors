# QoRS - Quantum-Resistant Optimal Reversible Security

Welcome to QoRS, a modern block cipher designed for robust security in the era of quantum computing while offering high performance and ease of integration.

## Overview

QoRS stands for **Quantum-Resistant Optimal Reversible Security**. It is engineered to provide secure data encryption with the following key attributes:

- **Quantum Resistance:** Designed to withstand potential attacks from quantum computers.
- **Optimal Performance:** Balances strong security with efficient performance for both software and hardware implementations.
- **Reversible Security:** Ensures that the encryption and decryption processes are tightly coupled for reliable and secure data transformation.

In this project, we are implementing QoRS using **C#**. C# provides a robust framework with excellent support for cryptographic operations, while its strong type checking and comprehensive library support make it an ideal choice for secure system development.

## How It Works

At a high level, QoRS employs a classic block cipher structure enhanced with modern design improvements:

1. **Key Schedule:**
   - Generates round-specific keys from a master key.
   - Designed to thwart related-key attacks and ensure randomness in key transformations.

2. **Round Function:**
   - Combines substitution (using S-boxes) and permutation (diffusion) layers.
   - Integrates round keys during each step to secure the transformation of data.
   - Utilizes multiple rounds to progressively enhance security.

3. **Reversible and Constant-Time Operations:**
   - Encryption and decryption operations are strictly reversible.
   - Where possible, operations are implemented in a constant-time fashion to mitigate timing and side-channel attacks.

4. **Modular Design:**
   - The design divides the cipher into clear modules: core algorithm, key schedule, and utility functions.
   - This modular approach allows for straightforward updates, testing, and collaborative development between human programmers and AI code generation.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/src/Core:** Contains the core encryption and decryption logic.
- **/src/Keys:** Implements the key schedule and associated cryptographic utilities.
- **/src/Utils:** Provides helper functions and support for data format conversions.
- **/tests:** Contains unit tests to verify the correctness and security of the cipher.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sarp75/qors.git
    cd qorS
    ```

2. **Set Up the C# Environment:**
   - Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed. You can download it from [Microsoft .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
   - Create a new solution or work within the provided solution structure.

3. **Build the Project:**
    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

4. **Run Tests (Future Implementation):**
    ```bash
    dotnet test
    ```

## Code Example

Below is a simple scaffold of what a core encryption class might look like in C#:

```csharp name=CoreEncryption.cs
using System;

namespace QoRS.Core
{
    public class CoreEncryption
    {
        private byte[] masterKey;

        public CoreEncryption(byte[] key)
        {
            if(key == null || key.Length == 0)
                throw new ArgumentException("Key cannot be null or empty", nameof(key));
            masterKey = key;
        }

        public byte[] Encrypt(byte[] plaintext)
        {
            // Placeholder for encryption algorithm.
            // 1. Generate round keys from masterKey.
            // 2. Run through substitution and permutation rounds.
            // 3. Return ciphertext.
            return plaintext; // Replace with actual encryption.
        }
        
        public byte[] Decrypt(byte[] ciphertext)
        {
            // Placeholder for decryption algorithm.
            // Reverse the encryption process using generated round keys.
            return ciphertext; // Replace with actual decryption.
        }
    }
}
```

## Future Work

- **Develop Core Components:** Continue to implement and refine the key schedule, round functions, and overall encryption/decryption logic.
- **Enhance Testing:** Expand unit tests and integration tests to thoroughly assess both encryption correctness and resistance to known attacks.
- **Security Audits:** Organize internal and external peer reviews to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
- **Performance Tuning:** Benchmark QoRS against other modern ciphers and optimize the implementation for various hardware and software environments.
